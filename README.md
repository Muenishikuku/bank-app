## Bank App

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing bank accounts. The application allows users to create accounts, add transactions, and view transaction history.


## Installation

To install the application, follow these steps:

 1  Clone the repository to your local machine.
 2  Navigate to the project directory.
 3  Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
 4  Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate
 5  Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To use the application, run the following command:

python3 bank/cli.py

This will start the CLI and display a menu of options. To select an option, enter the corresponding number and press Enter. Follow the prompts to complete the selected action.


The available options are:

 1 Init DB: Initializes the database.
 2 List Users: Lists all users in the database.
 3 List Accounts: Lists all accounts in the database.
 4 View Transactions: Displays transaction history for a specified account.
 5 Add User: Adds a new user to the database.
 6 Add Account: Adds a new account to the database.
 7 Add Transaction: Adds a new transaction to the database.
 8 Exit: Exits the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "'int' object is not iterable" error when trying to view transactions or add a new transaction, make sure you are using the updated code that includes the add_transaction command with two arguments: account_id and amount.
